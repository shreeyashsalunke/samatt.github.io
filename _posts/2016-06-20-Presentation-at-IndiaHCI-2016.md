<h2>Paper title</h2>
TactAlive: Context Aware Variable Tactile Key Interface <br>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
In this paper, we introduce, a bidirectional haptic I/O which varies its tactility depending on the context of the device. The keys in the interface make the user alter their applied fingertip force depending on the criticality, physicality and other attributes of the context. The interface can have many levels of tactility: soft press to hard press. Beyond the utilitarian values, the interactions are designed to alter the user behavior by making them context aware. This project attempts to expand our understanding of the context, and entirely reshape our interactions based on this understanding.
